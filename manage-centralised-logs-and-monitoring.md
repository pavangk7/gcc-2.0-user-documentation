# Overview of GCC 2.0 logging system

- IM8 (INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY 7.2/S1<sup>C1</sup> , 7.2/S6<sup>## C2</sup>) mandates that all security-related events generated by your systems must be kept for at least 12 months to aid investigation parties.
- GCC 2.0 offers a central logging system to store and retrieve these log files.
- Logs older than one year will be automatically purged by the CSPâ€™s storage lifecycle management

This document tells you how the logs are piped to central logging system for different cloud service providers.
