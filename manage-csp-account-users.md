>**Note:**
>- The requestor receives an email notification about the approval or rejection of the CSP account creation.
>- If a request is approved, the new users are added to the CSP account and their status changes from **Pending** to **Enabled**.
>- After the cloud users are added to the CSP account, it may take up to one hour to assign all the access rights to a newly created CSP user account. So as a cloud user, if you are facing difficulties to launch your console or Portal of your cloud service provider, try again after sometime.
