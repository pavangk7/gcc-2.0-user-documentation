<details><summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">While migrating from GCC 1.0 to GCC 2.0, should agency migrate their data logs too?</summary>

It is up to the agency to migrate their data logs from GCC 1.0 to GCC 2.0 or retain them on GCC 1.0.
GovTech recommends agency to do a cost analysis between migrating data logs to GCC 2.0 and retaining them on GCC 1.0.

Note, agency will be billed for the data logs in GCC 1.0 and agency can still access their buckets on GCC 1.0.
