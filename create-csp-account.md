# Create cloud service provider account

**Prerequisite:** Your agency must have a [GCC 2.0 tenant account](create-tenant-account).

Agencies can create and manage their cloud accounts using CMP, and this has the following workflow:

- [Request for a CSP account](#request-for-a-CSP-account)
- [Retract CSP account creation request](#retract-csp-account-creation-request)
- [Approve or reject CSP account creation request](#approve-or-reject-csp-account-creation-request)
- [View CSP account](#view-csp-account)

## Request for a CSP account
Generally, Tenant Admins request for CSP accounts. Tenant Manager can also request for a CSP account provided the tenant account has more than one Tenant Manager so that the other Tenant Manager(s) can be assigned as approver(s) for this request.

> **Important note:** Your cloud account will be pre-setup with certain services and charged accordingly. For example, if you are creating an AWS account, AWS Security Hub will be turned on to meet the security requirements, and you will be charged for it immediately when the account gets created.

**To submit a CSP account creation request**
1. [Log in to the Cloud Management Portal](log-in-to-cmp). The **Dashboard** displays the available tenant accounts.
2. Locate the required tenant account and click **Manage**.

## Retract CSP account creation request
Requestor may retract a submitted request that is pending approval for the following reasons:
- requested approvers are not available
- requestor wants to assign a different approver
- request is no longer valid.

When you retract a request, you may have to provide a reason for retracting the request and the request status changes from **Pending** to **Cancelled** and will be listed under **Notifications** > **Approvals** > **Cancelled**.

**To retract a CSP account creation request**
1. [Log in to the Cloud Management Portal](log-in-to-cmp).

## Approve or reject CSP account creation request

When a Tenant Admin or Tenant Manager submits a CSP account creation request, the Tenant Managers assigned as approvers in the request will be notified via email to process the request.
Approving Tenant Manager reviews the request details before approving or rejecting the CSP account creation.

> **Note:**
> A request is processed if one of the assigned approvers approves or rejects the request.

**To approve or reject a CSP account creation request**

1. [Log in to the Cloud Management Portal](log-in-to-cmp).
2. Go to notifications ![notifications-icon](images/notifications-icon.png) > **Approvals**.
<kbd>![go-to-approvals](images/go-to-approvals.png)</kbd>
3. Select **Pending** and then go to the **Received** tab to view requests that are waiting your approval.
4. Locate the required CSP account creation request and click **Go To**.
<kbd>![view-request-details-for-approvals](images/view-csp-account-details-for-approval.png)</kbd>
5. Review the request details and enter your comments in **Approver Comments**.
6. Select **Accept** or **Reject** as needed.
<kbd>![approve-or-reject](images/approve-or-reject-csp-account.png)</kbd>

  The requestor receives an email notification about the approval or rejection. If the request is approved, you can find it in **Notifications** > **Approvals** > **Approved**. If the request was rejected, you can find it in **Notifications** > **Approvals** > **Rejected**.  

  After a request is approved, GCC 2.0 platform provisions the CSP account. After the approval, it may take up to one hour to provision the requested CSP account. When the cloud account is provisioned, the cloud service provider notifies the Tenant Admin.

  After the successful provisioning of the CSP account, the status of this new CSP account changes to **Success**. If the account provisioning failed, the status changes to **Failed**. If the provisioning fails, contact us at GCC 2.0_support@tech.gov.sg.


  > **Note:**  After a CSP account is provisioned, the respective cloud service provider may send multiple emails to the Tenant Admin requesting some actions to be completed. You can safely ignore these emails.

## View CSP account
Tenant Manager and Tenant Admin can view and manage users of a CSP account.

**To view CSP accounts**

1. [Log in to the Cloud Management Portal](log-in-to-cmp). The **Dashboard** displays the available tenant accounts.
2. Locate the required tenant account and click **Manage**.
