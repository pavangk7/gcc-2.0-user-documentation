# GCC billing report

This section helps you understand how to view the billing report for your tenant accounts and validate if the CSP costs associated with your actual cloud usage are accurate.

If there is any discrepancy in the costs listed on the billing report, agencies can raise a dispute with their CSP to resolve them.

If there is no discrepancy in the CSP cost, GovTech will proceed to generate an invoice based on this billing report. Generated invoices are available by the end of the month, and agencies have a 30-day credit term to complete their payment.

## Prerequisites

To view the GCC billing report for your agency using CMP, you need to be a WOG user with the following roles on the GCC platform.

- Tenant Manager
- Tenant Admin
- Tenant Billing Admin

> **Note:**
>- Users with **Cloud Admin** and **Cloud Billing Admin** roles can access the cost and billing tools available in the cloud console or cloud portal.
>- If needed, your agency can assign a dedicated user as **Tenant Billing Admin** to view the GCC billing report and the **Cloud Billing Admin** role to access the [cost and billing tools](#guidelines-for-csp-cost-analysis-tool).
