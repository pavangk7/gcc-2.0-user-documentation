# About Cloud Management Portal

GCC 2.0 has a Cloud Management Portal(CMP), which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users. While public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can request for tenant and cloud accounts using CMP, authorised users can manage these accounts and their users through CMP.

## Audience

- Public officers
- Vendors

## Prerequisite(s) to onboard GCC 2.0

- [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/) account
- [SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/) to securely access CMP from a non-GSIB device.
-  Your agency must have an [ITSM project](support/support-channels). This is required to raise support requests for issues with GCC 2.0 services.

## Supported devices

- Non-SE GSIB devices
- Government Managed Device

>**Note:** For more information about these devices, refer to the [GCC glossary](glossary).

## How to get TechPass and SEED provisioning

- Public officers, vendors or contractors with WOG email address (i.e gov.sg) using non-SE GSIB device can sign up for TechPass account and SEED via [TechPass portal](portal.techpass.gov.sg/).

- If you are a public officer using a SE-GSIB device and intend to request for TechPass or SEED, create a [service request](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr) with us.

- Alternatively, another public officer can invite you to TechPass and SEED via the [TechBiz portal](portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg).

## Onboard to TechPass and SEED

Refer to the [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/) and [SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding) documentations.

> **Note**:
>- If you already have an active TechPass account and only need to onboard your non-GSIB device or non-DWP (internet device) to SEED, [request SEED provisioning](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-to-seed).
>
>- If you have issues in signing up for TechPass account or activating your TechPass account, [create a support request](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr).
