# About Cloud Management Portal

GCC 2.0 has a Cloud Management Portal(CMP), which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users. While public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can request for tenant and cloud accounts using CMP, authorised users can manage these accounts and their users through CMP.

## Audience

- Public officers
- Vendors

## Prerequisite(s) to onboard GCC 2.0

- [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/) account, the identity and access management service.
- [SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/) to securely access CMP from a non-GSIB device.
-  Your agency must have an [ITSM project](support/create-itsm-project). This is required to raise support requests for issues with GCC 2.0 services.

## Supported devices

## How do I request for TechPass and SEED provisioning?

Following are the different ways available for public officers and vendors to request for TechPass and SEED provisioning:

- Public officers or vendors who have a non-SE GSIB device, can use that device to go to the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/public/home), and self-sign up for TechPass and SEED.
- Public officers with a non-SE GSIB device can also use it to [log into the TechBiz portal using the OTP method](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/log-in-to-TechBiz-portal?id=log-in-with-techpass-otp) and self-invite yourself to get the TechPass and SEED onboarding emails.
- Public officers with a non-SE GSIB device can use it to [invite other public officers and vendors through TechBiz portal](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/invite-users) to send them TechPass and SEED onboarding emails.
- Public officers who have a SE-GSIB device and needs TechPass or SEED or both, has to [create service requests](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr) for TechPass and SEED provisioning.
- Vendors who do not have a non-SE GSIB device can also contact their reporting officers or project managers for the onboarding invitations. For more information, refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-vendors-to-techpass).


## How do I complete my TechPass and SEED onboarding?

Refer to the [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/) and [SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding) documentations.

> **Note**:
>- If you already have an active TechPass account and only need to onboard your non-GSIB device or non-DWP (internet device) to SEED, [request SEED provisioning](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-to-seed).
