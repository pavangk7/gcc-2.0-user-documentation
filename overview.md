# About Cloud Management Portal


GCC 2.0 has a Cloud Management Portal(CMP), which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users.

Public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can request for tenant and cloud accounts using CMP and authorised users can manage these accounts and users through CMP 2.0.

## Audience

- Public officers

- Vendors

## Supported devices

- Non-SE GSIB devices
- Government Managed Device(GMD).

>**Note:**
> When you onboard your internet device to SEED, it becomes a GMD. For more information about these devices, refer to the [GCC glossary](glossary).

## Prerequisite(s) to onboard GCC 2.0

1. You must have an active TechPass account and if you need to access CMP 2.0 from your internet device, you must onboard it to SEED.

> **Notes for users who need TechPass and SEED provisioning**:
>
>- Public officers, vendors or contractors with WOG email address (i.e gov.sg) using non-SE GSIB device can sign up for TechPass account and SEED via [TechPass portal](portal.techpass.gov.sg/). For more information, refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/) and [SEED documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding).
>
>- If you are a public officer using a SE-GSIB device and intend to request for TechPass or SEED, create a [service request](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr) with us.
>
>- Alternatively, another public officer can invite you to TechPass and SEED via the [TechBiz portal](portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg).
>
>- If you already have an active TechPass account and only need to onboard your internet device to SEED, request only for SEED provisioning.
>
>- If you have issues in signing up for TechPass account or activating your TechPass account, [create a support request](https://go.gov.sg/techpass-sr). For more information, refer to [support](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/gcc-version-2-user-documentation/support/support-channels)page.

2. Your agency must have an [ITSM project](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/gcc-version-2-user-documentation/support/support-channels?id=create-itsm-project). This is required to raise support requests for issues with GCC 2.0 services.
