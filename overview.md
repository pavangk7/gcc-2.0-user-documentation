# About Cloud Management Portal

[GCC 2.0](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/overview-of-gcc-version-2/#/) Cloud Management Portal(CMP) which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users. While public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can use CMP to submit requests to create tenant and cloud accounts, authorised users can manage these accounts and their users from CMP.

## Audience

- Public officers
- Vendors or Contractors


## Supported devices

- Non-SE GSIB devices
- Government Managed Device

>**Note:** For more information about these devices, refer to the [GCC glossary](glossary).

**Prerequisites to access CMP**

1. Active TechPass account. Refer to the additional information on getting the onboarding invitation emails.
2. [ITSM project](support/create-itsm-project).
3. If you want to access CMP or SGTS resources from the agency-provided internet device, [onboard your internet device to SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/onboard-device-to-seed).


> **Additional information on getting TechPass and SEED onboarding invitation**:
>  
> If you are a public officer, vendor or contractor using a non-SE GSIB device and need a TechPass account and SEED provisioning, there are two methods to get the onboarding invitation emails.
>
>- Method 1: You can self-sign up using the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/) and onboard to TechPass and onboard your internet device to SEED. Refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-public-officers-using-non-se-machines)
>
>- Method 2: Other public officers can send you the onboarding invitation emails for TechPass and SEED via the [TechBiz portal](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/). If you are a public officer inviting other users via TechBiz, refer to [TechBiz documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/invite-users)
>
> If you are a vendor or contractor who does not have a non-SE GSIB device, contact your reporting officer, who will request the engaging agency to send the TechPass and SEED onboarding emails to you. Refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-vendors-to-techpass).
>
> If you have issues in signing up for a TechPass account or activating your TechPass account, raise a service request with the [TechPass support](https://go.goc.sg/techpass-sr).

> **Additional information on getting only SEED onboarding invitation**
>
> If you are a public officer, vendor or contractor using a non-SE GSIB device and have received the TechPass onboarding email or already have an active TechPass account and now need only the SEED provisioning, go to [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/) and [request for SEED provisioning](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-to-seed).
>
> If you are a vendor or contractor who only has an internet device and has received the TechPass onboarding email or already has an active TechPass account and now needs only the SEED provisioning, create a [service request](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5f69797d0666cb0011cc59da) for SEED provisioning.
