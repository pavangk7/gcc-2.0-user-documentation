# About Cloud Management Portal

[GCC 2.0](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/overview-of-gcc-version-2/#/) has a Cloud Management Portal(CMP), which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users. While public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can request for tenant and cloud accounts using CMP, authorised users can manage these accounts and their users through CMP.

## Audience

- Public officers
- Vendors

## Prerequisite(s) to onboard GCC 2.0

- [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/), the identity and access management service.
- [SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/) to securely access government engineering resources from your non-GSIB device.

## Supported devices
- Non-SE GSIB devices
- Government Managed Device

>**Note:** For more information about these devices, refer to the [GCC glossary](glossary).

**Prerequisites to access CMP**

1. From your non-SE GSIB device, go to the [TechPass Portal](https://Portal.techpass.gov.sg/) and sign up for [TechPass account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-public-officers-using-non-se-machines). If you need to access CMP or SGTS resources from the agency-provided internet device, request SEED provisioning while signing up for TechPass.

> **Alternative methods to get TechPass and SEED onboarding invitations**:
>- If you are a public officer, you may [log into the TechBiz portal using the OTP method](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/log-in-to-TechBiz-portal?id=log-in-with-techpass-otp) and self-invite yourself to get the TechPass and SEED onboarding emails.
>- If you are a public officer, you may [invite other public officers and vendors through TechBiz portal](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/invite-users) so that they receive the TechPass and SEED onboarding emails.
>- Vendors who do not have a non-SE GSIB device can contact their reporting officers or project managers for the onboarding invitations. For more information, refer to [TechPass documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-vendors-to-techpass).

>**Notes:**
>- If you already have a TechPass and need to onboard your internet device to SEED, [request SEED provisioning](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-to-seed).
>- If you have issues in signing up for TechPass account or activating your TechPass account, raise a service request with the [TechPass support](https://go.goc.sg/techpass-sr).

2. Your agency must have an [ITSM project](support/create-itsm-project).
3. If you want to access CMP or SGTS resources from the agency-provided internet device, [onboard your internet device to SEED](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/onboard-device-to-seed).
