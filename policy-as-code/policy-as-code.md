# 1.GCC 2.0 Policy as Code - Overview

## 1.1.Audience

This playbook is intended for the following agency users:

- Agency Chief Information Security Officer (ACISO)
- Agency Security Incident Response Officer (ASIRO) and
- Account administrators.

## 1.2. Key things to take note

- Agency can't modify the clm-pac rules deployed to their agency account.
- Agency can't modify resources used by clm-pac which has a tag key gcc:team and value as gcci.
- In addition to clm-pac rules, agency can define and add additional PaC rules to their account .
- Agency can additionally add up to 391 more custom config rules within their accounts
- In addition to resources used by clm-pac, agencies can also add additional tags.

## 1.3.Background

Policy as Code (PaC) custom rule is introduced as part of GCC2.0's enhancement to provide additional security coverage for organisation-specific security requirements. PaC acts a detection service that alerts agency administrators/CISO/SIRO of non-compliant resources and does not perform intrusive actions such as modifying, adding, or deleting any resources.

GCC2.0 adopts a _light-touch_ approach in compliance monitoring to improve security posture while ensuring that the security measures are not overly restrictive.

AWS Security Hub is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) that checks AWS services and resources against security best practices and aggregates compliance alerts onto the Security Hub Findings dashboard.

Security Hub with AWS config and EventBridge are used in GCC 2.0 as the main PaC toolchain to detect non-compliant settings or resources in the tenant environment.

## 1.4.What does GCC 2.0 PaC cover

The following security standards are available on GCC 2.0:

| **#** | **Standards** | **Is it enabled by default?** | **Can it be disabled?** | **Industry Benchmark/Custom** | **Can it be modified?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark | Yes | No | Industry Benchmark | No |
| 2 | AWS Foundational Security Best Practices | Yes | Yes (Depending on agency's requirement) | Industry Benchmark | No |
| 3 | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) | No.
 Note: Agency may enable it if required) | Yes (Depending on agency's requirement)
 | Industry Benchmark | No |
| 4 | GovTech PaC rules | Yes | No | Custom | No |

Security Hub findings retention period:

- Findings are **retained for 90 days** and will be automatically removed from the dashboard after 90 days.
- Findings can be exported to S3 buckets for long-term storage:
  - To be configured by the agencies.
  - To export security hub findings to S3 buckets, setup security hub custom action and EventBridge rule. When the agency administrators export the findings to S3 buckets, they need to invoke the custom action manually on the security hub dashboard.
  - For detailed instructions, refer to the additional resources.

## 2.2.Batch 1 & 2 PaC Rules Remediation Steps

If there are any non-compliant PaC findings within the agency account's Security Hub, administrators may refer to the following remediation steps applicable to the PaC rules in section 2.2. For certain PaC rules, examples between a compliant and non-compliant resource are provided (for example, GT1.6 to GT2.4), which allows administrators/users to easily differentiate the resources' compliance status.

Note: PaC **does not** automatically remediate non-compliant resources.

**GT1.1 Ensure Cloudwatch event for snapshot creation failures is created**

To ensure agency account is compliant with GT1.1, create an **EventBridge** rule that detects and alerts administrators of EBS snapshot creation failure.

# 3.Compliance Management on Aws Security Hub

If the non-compliant PaC Security Hub findings has been resolved, administrators canhave the option to remove the resolved finding from the dashboard via using alert suppression. Alternatively, if the PaC findings are not applicable to the aAgency account, administrators may also supress those findings that are not required.

## 3.1.Suppressing Alerts

In an event where the aAgency deems certain Security Hub findings as not applicable (_for example,e.g. IAM.6 Hardware MFA shall be enabled for the root user_ - as aAgency accounts does not utilisze hardware MFA), the findings can be supressed via using AWS Security Hub Findings Dashboard on Management Console or through AWS CLI.

3.1.1. To sSuppress PaC findings via using AWS Console:

 ![Shape7](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_e0f68a6081b1859f.gif)
1. Log in to AWS Tenant Account.
2. Go to AWS Security Hub \> Findings . ![Shape8](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_1f6d2919513d9470.gif) ![Shape9](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_1f6d2919513d9470.gif)- \> Select findings (to be suppressed) and \>
- CClick on ' **Workflow status'** \> Select ' **Supressed'**

![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_f3f1629aef21c97.png)

You have now successfully suppressed the PaC Findings has now been suppressed successfully.

3.1.2. To sSuppress PaC findings via using AWS CLI:

1. On awsapps SSO page \> Select 'Command line or programmatic access' \> Copy and paste AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key and Session Token into ~/.aws/credentials file in account administrator's local terminal

![Shape10](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_fa177ece3a9e5bab.gif)

**AWS\_CLI\_PROFILE**

![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_1e4f65f480be240d.png)

1. Using AWS CLI, provide the target Finding Title to retrieve finding's Id and ProductArn:

| aws securityhub get-findings --filters '{"Title":[{"Value": "_ **FINDING\_TITLE** _","Comparison":"EQUALS"}]}' --profile **AWS\_CLI\_PROFILE** --region ap-southeast-1 |
| --- |

CLI Results Syntax: Copy _ **FINDING\_ID** _ & _ **FINDING\_PRODUCT\_ARN** _ from results \> To be used in Step 3:

![Shape15](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_df08ce17ee18263.gif) ![Shape12](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_1fe1b01e0aae9301.gif) ![Shape14](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_a774aaa6755eea23.gif) ![Shape16](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_586f356401ccd189.gif) ![Shape11](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_597b3604cb0ea31b.gif) ![Shape13](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_5ee56d03b1b677d5.gif)

_ **FINDING\_ID** _

_ **FINDING\_PRODUCT\_ARN** _

 ![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_23a0500e81da046.png)

![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_8e926ed53472777e.png)

1. Paste the _ **FINDING\_ID** _ & _ **FINDING\_PRODUCT\_ARN** _ obtained from Step 2 into the following command to suppress PaC findings:

| aws securityhub batch-update-findings --finding-identifiers Id="_ **FINDING\_ID** _",ProductArn="_ **FINDING\_PRODUCT\_ARN** _" --workflow Status="SUPPRESSED" --profile **AWS\_CLI\_PROFILE** --region ap-southeast-1 |
| --- |

![Shape17](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_22e130c39f2dab9a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_e665e9e6c48fd733.png)

![](RackMultipart20221019-1-6mthxk_html_c056d85c0de63686.png)

Finding is suppressed successfully if the _Id_ and _ProductArn_ is reflected under "ProcessedFindings" in CLI result.

## 3.2.Setup Security Hub alerts to Email/Slack/ServiceNow ITSM

Asides from viewing PaC related alerts on Security Hub, if a resource is non-compliant, PaC detects it and notifies the agency administrators through the preferred channel.

Agency administrators can also receive notifications either via through one or more of the following channels:

- Email: Notifications will be sent through a setup comprising of Simple Notification Service (SNS), EventBridge rule and a Lambda function from agency account to email inbox.

, Slack: Notifications will be sent through SNS and Chatbot from agency account to Slack Channel.

and/or

- ITSM: Notifications will be sent via a CloudFormation Stack Security Hub-ITSM Connector from agency account to ServiceNow instance.
- .

Notifications will be sent to the preferred platforms whenever PaC detects any resources that are non-compliant.

- Email

Notifications will be sent via a setup comprising of Simple Notification Service (SNS), EventBridge rule and a Lambda function from Agency account to email inbox.

- Slack

Notifications will be sent via SNS and Chatbot from Agency account to Slack Channel.

- ServiceNow ITSM

Notifications will be sent via a CloudFormation Stack Security Hub-ITSM Connector from Agency account to ServiceNow instance.

Please refer to Section 6: References for more information.

# 4.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. Why is there a SNS topic residing in the us-east-1 region? (Iinstead of ap-southeast-1?)

1. The SNS topic , (clm-pac-forward-iam-events-topics,) was intentionally hosted on the us-east-1 to send event logs of events that took place within that region. Some AWS services such as (e.g. IAM) operates on global endpoint, which is hosted in the us-east-1. The SNS topic is connected to a Lambda function (clm-pac-iam-event-sns-to-EventBridge) that processes and logs all events that have taken place within AWS services hosted on global endpoint regions.

1. Can agencies disassociate their accounts from the security hub?

1. No, agency accounts remain associated to with the security hub.

1. Can administrators disable any of the services used by PaC such as (Security Hub and , Config etc.) used by PaC?

1. Security hub, config and EventBridge must be enabled on agency accounts for PaC to work normallycorrectly.

1. Can administrators manage multiple agency more than one account of their agency s on a centralised security hub dashboard?

1. No, agency administratorsaccounts do not have permission to add accounts into the security hub. This feature is managed by GCCI administrators.

1. Are the services used by PaC such as (e.g. Security Hub and b, Config) used by PaC automatically enabled on agency account?

1. Yes, security hub and config are automatically enabled in new agency accounts.
