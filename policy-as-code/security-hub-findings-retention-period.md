# Security Hub findings retention period

Security Hub findings retention period:

- Findings will be retained and stored at the dashboard for 90 days. Findings will be removed from the dashboard afterwards.
- After 90 days, findings are automatically exported to central GCCI log for long term storage.
- Agency is not required to setup services for exporting of findings, as the setup has already been deployed in agency accounts.
