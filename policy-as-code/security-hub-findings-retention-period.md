# Security Hub findings retention period

Security Hub findings retention period:

- Findings are retained and available on the AWS Security Hub Dashboard for 90 days. 
- After 90 days, the findings are automatically removed from this dashboard and GCC automatically export the findings to the central GCCI log for long-term storage.
- As GCC takes care of this export, agency need not set up any service for this.
